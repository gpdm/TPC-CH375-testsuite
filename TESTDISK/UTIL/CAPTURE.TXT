CAPTURE.COM (Screen Capture v2.01)

A non-TSR screen capturing utility

        Capture v2.01 is a small program (1,616 bytes) that can take the ASCII
image on the screen, in its exact colours or attributes, and save it to a file.
Screen Capture supports both monochrome and colour displays. Screen Capture's
syntax is as follows:

CAPTURE [play] mode
mode is either C (for colour), M (for monochrome), or T (for plain text)

(eg. The following command will save a colour text image: CAPTURE C)
(eg. The following command will play back a colour image: CAPTURE PLAY C)

        If you type play preceding the screen mode, Screen Capture will play
back the previous recording. A colour capture is saved to the file COLOUR.VID
in the current directory, and a monochrome screen capture is saved to the file
MONO.VID. If you switch these files around (i.e. rename a monochrome capture
file as a colour file) the file will still display normally.
        A colour and monochrome capture, when played back, will show the text
on the screen in its original colours and/or attributes. A text capture feature
was added so that you can capture the text on the screen, regardless of screen
type, and have it saved to a file (TEXT.VID) which may be edited by any text
editor. The TEXT.VID file can, of course, be played back if you wish. The plain
text file may not be renamed as COLOUR.VID or MONO.VID.
